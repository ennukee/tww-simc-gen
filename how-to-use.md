# How to use configurables output

## Run a quick sim

When complete, scroll to the bottom and look for **"Raw Input"**. Open it, and **copy that large string into a notepad**

This will ensure all defaults are set correctly, such as

 - Dawnthread/Duskthread uptime
 - PI
 - Flask, rune, food, or essence config (if you do not want to include it in the profileset gen)

## Use the site to generate the profilesets

Select the consumables you want to check. Turn on the offhand toggle if you are a dual wielding melee class who can use two runes.

Click "Generate simc string" and then either the "Copy" button, or copy it manually via the textarea created below the toggles.

## Attach it to your raw input notepad

In the same notepad as earlier where you copied the Raw Input from a quick sim, **paste the output of the website BELOW everything in that notepad**.

## Run an Advanced Sim

This will ONLY work in Advanced Sim, due to custom profilesets
